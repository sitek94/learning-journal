## Morning learning 

In the morning I started chapter 15 about event handlers. It's really cool, I haven't even read half of it yet and I've already found some
valuable examples, like scrolling and dragging events.

## Habit tracker

Wow. So many things today. At first I started to feel a little bit overwhelmed with everything and I was starting to think that I'm going 
in circles all the time without actually making any progress. But it's not true at all. Slowly, step by step, work is going forward.

I start to understand more and more mongodb, well at least it's not such a dark magic as it was at the beginning. I can make it do what I want 
after reading a lot of documentations, stack overflow and watching some yt but it is definitely possible :D

Finally, today I decided to give redux a go and first tested it on just a template counter app and I loved it. I've already wired up 
first component with it - DateRange to select current range of dates.

## Tomorrow Sunday

So I'm going to chill a little, maybe think about portfolio, take a look at pocket globe, I'll see.
