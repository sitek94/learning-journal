## Morning learning

Handling events exercises. I've been playing around a lot with second exercise, here's the result:

I've also started working on the last one and it's pretty much finished. Final touch tomorrow.

## Habit tracker

Well, I've been trying to set up login and authentication and it actually worked but I didn't really liked the way I implemented that.
I didn't know how to create a new user in database once I'm logged in and how to manage everything. So... 

I took a step back and started to build a small project along with traversy's tutorial and I've already started to reimplement some of the habit tracker logic.

The biggest problem I have at the moment is that when I click on **sign in with google** and intend to make a get request to actually login I get a CORS error.

I'll try to fix it tomorrow.
