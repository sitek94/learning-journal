## Habit tracking app

Most of the day I have been experimenting with nivo.rocks charts. I've been playing around in codesandbox to get to know how to
implement these charts in my app. Then I also had to figure out how to convert data from the database so that it is usable for visualization.

By the end of the day I think that I've got an idea how to do all this and I've already written some functions to parse the date. Tomorrow I'll have to 
write some tests and the on to implementation of the charts in the app!
