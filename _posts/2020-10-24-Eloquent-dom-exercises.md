## Morning learning 

I started doing exercises from chapter 14. I thought that it's going to be quite simple but of course I learned a lot by solving them.

## Habit tracker

Half a day I've been looking for a way to update nested array in mongodb but I managed to do that, then I've had some problems with
`dayjs` throwing strange errors - funny enough at last I had to restart local server and that was it... :D

By the end of the day I also implemented `/toggle/:dateId' route to toggle completion of the habit on a particular day.
