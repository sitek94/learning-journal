## Learned:
* What is the main concept of 'testing-library/react'
  Basically what it does looking from perspective of using 'testing-library/dom' 
* How to mock with Jest
* Learned the hard way that I don't have to install Jest when using create-react-app because
  it comes with Jest already
* After watching some tutorials on YT, started to write some tests myself in pomodoro-clock app

## Done:
* Uploaded gym-contact-form to gh-pages
* Changed a little bit fo code in product-landing-page, mostly media queries
* Posted product landing page to review on freeCodeCamp forum and later fixed some small bugs
* Responed to two or three issues on the fcc forum

## Problems:
* I wasn't sure how to validate prop value for testing purposes, so I asked on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63381649/how-to-validate-props-that-are-passed-to-a-component-by-value)
