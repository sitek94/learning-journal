## Morning learning - Eloquent JavaScript

I finished chapter 8 about debugging + all the exercises by the end of the chapter.

Also started reading chapter 9 about Regular Expressions.

## Pocket globe app

First couple of hours I spent debugging this nasty memory leaks from yesterday. 

1. I reproduced the issue in codesandbox.
1. I found the reason why is this happening.
1. I fixed this isolated issue.
1. I moved on to fixing this in my app.
1. BOOM, everything works!

Also I extracted some logic to separate files and cleaned up a lot of code, smashing day!
