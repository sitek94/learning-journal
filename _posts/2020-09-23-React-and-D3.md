## React 

After quite some time of working mainly with d3 I moved on to creating data visualizations with React and D3.

Now that I have basic understanding of d3, combining it with React is a game changer. It's so easy to organize everything.

## VizHub

On VizHub platform I went through some tutorials and went over following topics:
* first steps with React and d3
* interaction with React
* parsing, cleaning and processing csv data
* loading data with React and d3
* rendering data with React

## Bar Chart and Scatter Plot

Then I created Bar Chart and Scatter Plot using React and D3. 

## Curran Kelleher

Generally I've been going through videos by Curran to learn more about D3 but honestly I learned so much other stuff in the same
time that it's incredible. 
I'll leave here his youtube channel for future reference.
