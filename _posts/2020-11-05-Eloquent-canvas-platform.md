## Morning learning

I continued to going through chapter 17 on canvas. Started to implement Canvas Display for the platform game.

## Habit tracker

I've been flying through the tasks for today until I started to reimplement some logic with React Hook Form.
It's really cool library but I'm struggling to set up multiple checkboxes for tracked days. 

When it seems that everything is working I cannot reset the values after submitting the form. I'll keep on trying tomorrow.
