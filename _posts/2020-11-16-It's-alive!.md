## Habit tracking app

Well I can say that the app is working :D It's far from being finished but the main functionality is done and now I have add
additional features, cleanup and organize the code, test it, style and do so much more but it's really cool already. 

So far I've been trying to write here what I did today but I also write this in the pull request message so I'm gonna just leave here
the message from pull request so that I don't write the same thing twice.

PR message:
* Charts from `nivo.rocks` line chart, bar chart and heatmap calendar
* Selecting dates range with `react-date-range`
* Dashboard layout components: `Layout`, `Drawer` and `AppBar`
* Modified checkmarks data structure - removed `skipped` value, for now at least
