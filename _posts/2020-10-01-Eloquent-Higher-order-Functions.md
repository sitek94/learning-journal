## Morning Learning

I went through Chapter 5: Higher-order Functions, it took me nearly two hours because I wanted to understand all the examples.

## Pocket Globe App

I think I got the color palette that is quite okay so I'll leave it, at least for now. Most of the time today I spent on 
clicking on countries and centering the display on the country clicked. Finally I managed to do it, unfortunally without transitions at the moment
as they're quite complicated to implement.

Before going forward I have to check the performance of the logic that does all this centering.
