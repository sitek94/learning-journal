## Done 
* I continued to watch materials on testing in the morning followed with some practice
* Solved two issues on fcc forum

## Learned
* **[React]** Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component

## Problems
* setting intervals in function components

Besides that I spent all day going back and forth with pomodoro-clock app. 
I couldn't get test 8 to pass which in the end had probably something to do with my laptop being very slow,
because when I uploaded the code to codesandbox it passed the test no problem.

Then I found even more problems. By the end of the day I realized that it has something to do with how I set intervals.
Looking at the code of other pomodoro-clock apps I finally got my code to pass the tests that I've had problem with.

So tomorrow I just have to find out what was causing these problems :D 

Score: 16 :tomato:
