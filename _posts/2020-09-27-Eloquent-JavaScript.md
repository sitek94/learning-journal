## Eloquent JavaScript

Sunday chill with an amazing book - [Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

I went through first two chapters already and also solved the first set of exercises.
* Chapter 1: Values, Types and Operators
* Chapter 2: Program Structure

  First exercise was to draw a triangle using `console.log` and `#`.
  
  I've done it before as well as other variations of the same exercise during CS50 
  but I was amazed when I checked the author's solution and its simplicity.
  ```
  for (let line = "#"; line.length < 8; line += "#")
    console.log(line);
  ```
  
  Last two exercies were FizzBuzz and Chessboard which I solved as well but again the author's solutions were much more simpler.
