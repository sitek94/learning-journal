## Treemap Diagram

I finished Treemap Diagram today:
https://github.com/sitek94/d3-treemap-diagram

Implemented General Update Pattern to all the components - legend took me quite some time, because
I was creating new `svg` element on each rerender.

Once all this was done, implementing animated transition was a breeze.

## Data Visualization Certification

Finally I submitted ready Treemap Diagram on the forum and on the learning platform and by doing that 
I completed Data Visualization Certification :D

## Next steps
Now I want to make my final personal project using d3 and React. I started to experiment with React and d3 already,
and explore some patterns and best practices.
