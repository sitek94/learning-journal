## Morning learning

In the morning I finished reading chapter 18 HTTP Forms and started working my way through exercises. Already finished first one.

## Habit tracking app

Testing day! I started writing tests, well... I started learning how to write tests so I haven't actually written a lot of them but
it was a good start. I finally wrapped my head around mocking and was able to mock `useFirebase` hook that exposes database instance 
and it worked! I was very happy about that :D 

Now I'm getting some problems with infinite loops when testing the component that fetches 
some data on initial render but this will have to wait till tomorrow.
