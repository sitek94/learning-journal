## Data visualization

I spent all day with data visualization using d3. At the moment I'm going through amazing
course by [Curran Kelleher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwd_9jyX4YtDYm9p9MxQqw).

My approach is that I'm coding along with him and then I'm practicing this new stuff by creating 
projects for freeCodeCamp data visualization certification. Today I covered:
* Line and area chart
* General update pattern
* Marks and channels in data visualization
* Unidirection data flow 
* Created interactive world map (zooming and panning)
    * Also, finally I've had a chance to practice Promise.all()
    
## Bar chart and Scatter plot

* Bar chart - finished and posted on the forum.
* Scatter plot - almost done, tomorrow I'm going to go through the video about creating and customizign a legend
so I'll practice this and create a legend for my scatter plot
