## What is prototype chain?

First hour of learning I spent on learning about protype chain. I've had basic idea 
of how things work but I feel much more confident now. I'm revisiting videos from udemy 
that I watched half a year ago and now I everything starts to click for me.

## From Choropleth Map to Webpack

I've finished already 3/5 data visualization projects and today I wanted to start to code 
Choropleth Map but I thought that it's going to be quite some code and it would be nice to 
split this code into separate modules. However, the problem was that I had only general idea
of how webpack works and what it does.

So I took [freeCodeCamp course on webpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpGLUVbqoYQ) - about 2hrs video - and it was so cool and helpful, I really 
learned a lot, so tomorrow I can set up webpack for my Choropleth Map and get going.

In the meantime I revied a tribute page and helped out with some problem with css grid and flex-box.
