## Habit tracking app

First couple hours of the day I have been trying to add `redux` and `react-redux-firebase` which was waaaay too much.
Once again I ended up in this rabbit hole of overcomplicating stuff. So after couple of hours I started over.

Step by step I started to convert the firestore to realtime database and some parts of app already work.

What is the most important part of this day is that I've finally found the solution for the Habit completion state.

I've had no idea how to store all these checkboxes that show whether the habits was completed, skipped or failed. I've read countless articles
and have been looking really long for some example databases for storing similar stuff. Finally I happened upon a solution when checking out
`uhabits` app. I'll write more about it tomorrow when I'll be sure that it actually works :D
