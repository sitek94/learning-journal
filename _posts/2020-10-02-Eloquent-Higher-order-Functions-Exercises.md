I have finished Chapter 5 exercises. Tomorrow I'm going to move on to next chapter which is about OOP.

## Pocket Globe App

I implemented transitions when clicking on a country!!!!! It's so cool, I wasn't sure that I'll find a way to do that but I did it :D

Then I've been trying to add labels to the countries but this is actually difficult at the moment. I couldn't even find examples of how to
do something similar. I leave it for now. 

Added tooltip for countries.
