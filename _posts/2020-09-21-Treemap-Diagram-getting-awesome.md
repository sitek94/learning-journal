## Treemap Diagram

Today I've been working all day on my treemap diagram. I've already finished all the user stories
and all the tests are passing but I want to make some additional features.

At the momement I'm working on General Update Pattern so that it is possible to change the datasets using 
dropdown menu.

Once this is done I think it shouldn't be a problem to animate the changes.
