## Learned:
* How to install puppeteer - I've had some problems at first running it on WSL
* Basic usage of puppeteer
* Written first end-to-end test
* How to create simple static website with jekyll and host it to gh-pages
* Maded my first Pull Request :D

## Done:
* Fixed small bugs in the Tribute Page Project
* Posted Survey Form Project on freeCodeCamp forum
* After two days of looking what was causing the tests in pomodoro-clock to fail I found the issue
  ```
  const [timer, setTimer] = useState(sessionLength * 60);
  ```
  I set `* 60` initially and didn't even give it a second thought later but in the end that was the problem.
