# Pomodoro Clock
Finally I got the pomodoro clock to work and to pass all the tests.

There was probably something wrong with the way I was making the calculations.

## Considerations: 
* If you have `user stories` to follow, first fulfill them before implementing your own ideas
* Pass all the tests, create new branch and then start tweaking the app that is already working

## Learning
In the morning I was filling in the blanks about HTTP Protocol and I learnt some useful things about:
* cache
* requests:
    * `GET`
    * `POST`
    * `PUT`
    
## Done
* explained two issues on the forum
* rewritten technical documentation page and posted in the forum
