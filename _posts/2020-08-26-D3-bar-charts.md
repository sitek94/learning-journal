## Bar charts

All they I've been learning and trying out creating bar charts using d3.
Materials I've been going over:
* fcc challenges
* official docs, examples and tutorials
* yt videos
* Finally I've found fcc course created by Curran Kelleher which is absolutely amazing
  and everything starts to _click_ in my head.
