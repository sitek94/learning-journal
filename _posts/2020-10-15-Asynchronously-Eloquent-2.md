## Morning learning 

I continue reading chapter 11 about asynchronous JavaScript. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out
what exactly is going on in the example functions, like `findRoute` and `requestRoute`. I wouldn't say it's dark magic
but it's quite complicated at this point.

## Pocket globe app

I spent all day styling widgets, like rotation, zoom, location and random country buttons. By the end of the day I've nearly
finished and what's more important, I'm happy with the result, so possibly tomorrow I'll implement click listeners.
