## Morning learning

In the morning I finished the chapter with platform game project. Now it's time for exercises!

## Habit tracker

Big progress: 

* It's now possible to add, edit and view all the habits.
* `AddHabitPage` is practically fully implemented.
* Implemented `Snackbar` component that can be used through `SnackbarContext` across the app, so it's very easy.
* Started adding custom hooks to reduce the repetition of the code in the forms.
