## Morning learning 

In the morning I started reading second part of Eloquent JavaScript - Browser.
Chapter 13: JavaScript and the Browser is just theoretical knowledge and some history.
Chapter 14: The Document Object Model on the other hand is pure practice. I read the beginning and skimmed through the rest 
and it looks amazing - a lot of practice, examples and exercises!

## Habit tracker

I put on hold habit tracker app to get some undertanding of working with MongoDB in order to create a database for the app.
At the start I wanted to do that with Firebase because it's easier to setup (at least that's what I heard) but in the end I've decided 
to go with Mongo because I wanted to learn that anyway and I'm really curious how it is to work with NoSQL databases.

## Express and MongoDB

I finished freeCodeCamp section about basics of Node and Express, then I moved on to section about MongoDB but there is very little actual knowledge
so I started to look for other resources.

* React and Express starter pack by Traversy (yt)
* MongoDB crash course by Traversy (yt)
* started freeCodeCamp tutorial where we're going to create a simple app that wires app Mongo, Express and React - the exact knowledge that I need before moving 
on with my habit tracker app.
