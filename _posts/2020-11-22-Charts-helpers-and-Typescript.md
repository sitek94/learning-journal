## Habit tracking app

Most of the time I've been working on transforming the checkmarks data so that it can be used in the charts.
I've installed `typescript` and have written my first ever code using it. I really like the idea behind it and 
when I finish building this app I'm going to build some small project to learn more about typescript.
