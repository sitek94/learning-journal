What is the difference between classical and prototypal inheritance? 
* Classical inheritance is like a blueprint (or description) of an object to be created
* In Prototypal inheritance new objects are based on the prototype

There is no classical inheratince in JavaScript, there is pseudo classical pattern but there is no classical inheritance.

## d3 template

I put my knowledge from yesterday's course about webpack and today I created a d3 template that is bundled with webpack.
https://github.com/sitek94/d3-template

Now, whenever I want to create a new d3 project, instead of starting from scratch I can just use this template.
