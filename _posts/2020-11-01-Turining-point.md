## Finally

After going back and forth for ages, and starting over countless times I *think* that I'm on the right track.

I'm feeling more comfortable with Firebase now and I'm using Docs mostly instead of blindly following some tutorials.

I've got some basic routing, simple login and sign-up, logout and simple navbar. Not bad. It's something I can build on now. While testing everything as I go.
