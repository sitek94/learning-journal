## Morning learning 

Next chapter - Asynchronous Programming - really good way to solidfy what I've learned so far about 
async programming.

## Pocket globe app

I finished refactoring the app. Honestly I love it and everything is easy to find. I'll try to keep it this 
way. 

After refactoring I can start styling the widgets panel (zoom, rotate, location, etc.)
I've got already most of the design. I combined some stuff from material ui with google maps.
