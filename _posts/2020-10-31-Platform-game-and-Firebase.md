## Morning learning

Building platfomr game, part 2. It's now rendering background and actors in the DOM. Now time for movement.

## Habit tracker

I'm getting familiar with Firebase, and it really isn't that hard as I originally thought. My biggest problem is that I tend to overcomplicate things
and try to many things at once. 

I have to change that and build really small pieces and build up on the things that I have working and tested.

Don't try to build something as awesome as Material ui templates in one day.
