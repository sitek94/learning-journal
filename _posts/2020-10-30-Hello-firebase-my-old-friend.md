## Habit tracker app

So... For last couple of days, more than a week really I've been struggling to build this habit tracker app using tools that I don't really know.
My idea was to build it like this:
Backend: Express, Passport, MongoDB
Frontend: React, Redux, React Router

The thing is that I've never worked with express, passport, mongo. I have never really used react router and redux, only in tutorials so I haven't had really much
practice with them. As a result I've been really fighting to make even small progress.

Finally I decided to take two steps back. I'm going to take slightly different approach which should allow me to get more practice with Redux and React Router.
Instead of building my own backend from scratch I'll use Firebase.
