## Morning learning 

I finished reading the chapter about asynchronous programming and I've started going through the exercises.

While reading I've had some difficulties with undertanding the examples and even after going through them couple of
times I couldn't get it 100% but now thanks to the exercises it all finally starts to *click*.

## Pocket globe app - nearly there!

Today I improved global styling of the app, reduced some redundant code and what's the most important I finished 
styling search-box component. 

I've got left some minor tweaks with media queries, adding tooltips, maybe a little help section and the app should be ready.
