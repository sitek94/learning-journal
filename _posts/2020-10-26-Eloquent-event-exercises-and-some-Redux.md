## Morning learning

In the morning I finished reading the chapter about handling events and moved on to the exercises.
The exercises and not very difficult but it is possible to get very creative so I'm going to spend some time 
with them, especially that I'd like to practice `requestAnimationFrame`.

## Habit tracker

I've been working on implementing habits logic with Redux, I basically imitaded the example from the docs where they're
creating `posts reducer`. I found it to be almost exactly what I need so I modified it slightly. 

Also, I've written my first tests!

By the end of the day I started to implement OAuth2 authentication, so that I can move on with other things.
