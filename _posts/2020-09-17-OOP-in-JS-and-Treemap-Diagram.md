## Morning learning - How OOP works in JavaScript

I want to understand what exactly mean that JavaScript is multi-paradigm language. 
I've had a general idea about object oriented programming and functional programming but I didn't know
that multi-paradigm language refers to the fact that in JavaScript we can use both, OOP using prototypal
inheritance and functional programming using closures and first class functions.

Some codepen exercises with notes about How OOP works in JavaScript:

## Finished Choropleth Map

In the end Choropleth Map wasn't really ready to post it on the forum and I had to spend some time fixing minor bugs but 
finally I managed to finish it and it's now ready:

## Tree and Treemap

Last freeCodeCamp challange is about Treemap Diagram so as an introduction I watched and coded along tutorial about Tree Diagram,
final result is here:

Then I started to code the actual project, so far I managed to display rectangles that represent the data in the form of treemap diagram but 
it still needs customizing, adding labels, etc.
