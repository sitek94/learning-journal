# Sunday Review
Yesterday I wrote that today I'm going to finish random quote machine but I forgot that it's Sunday
so **"Summary, Review & Chill day"**. It'll have to wait until tomorrow :)

## Summary
* :heavy_check_mark: Finish Pomodoro App
Post finished projects on the forum to get feedback:
* :heavy_check_mark: Tribute Page
* :heavy_check_mark: Survey Form

* :hourglass: Random Quote Machine
* :hourglass: Personal Portfolio

This week I've started actively contributing to the freeCodeCamp forum by helping people, solving issues and
reviewing projects. While I'm not an expert I was still able to explain couple of things and I leant a lot 
in the same time :)
