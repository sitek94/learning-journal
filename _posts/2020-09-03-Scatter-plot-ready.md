## Scatter plot

I spent more time than I thought I will working on a scatter plot but it's finished now
I'll just have to update github repo with some information about it.

Simultaneously to working on scatter plot I've been working on d3 course:
* Color and Size Legends with D3.js
* The General Update Pattern of D3.js - I went once again through this 
lecture because I didn't really understood everything yesterday.

## Heatmap 

After I finished with scatter plot I started with heat map. I'm currently setting everything up.
For a while **I was struggling with overflow**. It just didn't work and I wanted to be able to scroll in x 
direction on smaller screens. **The problem was that I was setting display to flex on the container element.**
