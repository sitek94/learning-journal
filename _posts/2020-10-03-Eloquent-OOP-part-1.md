## Morning learning

Chapter 6 of Eloquent JavaScript - The Secret Life of Objects that is introduction to Object Oriented Programming.

I went through half of the chapter and learned about 
* Encapsulation - separating interface from implementation
* Prototypes
* Methods
* Classes and class notation
* Overriding derived properties

All the above concepts where somewhat familiar but the following ones where totally new: 
* A map data structure
* Polymorphism
* Symbols and Symbol.iterator

## Pocket Globe App

* highlight currently selected country 
* reorganize folder structure
* extract Layout component to separate file
* fix flickering photos
* add github repo icon
* add tooltips to navbar
* extract countries tooltip to separate component
* (in progress) modal component
