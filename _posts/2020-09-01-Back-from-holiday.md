## Getting started

After couple days of holiday I'm back in business. I've catched a cold or something
so spent only about 5 hours today but I should be all right tomorrow so I'll catch up 
quickly.

## Today

I finished bar chart and it's ready to post on the forum. Then I made a great progress with
scatter plot so it should be ready tomorrow.
