## Habit tracking app

I'm using [react query blog example](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query-blog-refactor-example) 
and [bookshelf](https://github.com/kentcdodds/bookshelf/tree/097849ffcf68dda53a6d15abc4ba00d351b48a6b) as reference points.

I've already finished `add-habit` and `manage-habits` routes and they're working fine. I'm now working on `edit-habit`.
