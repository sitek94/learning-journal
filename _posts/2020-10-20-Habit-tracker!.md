## Morning learning

Today I started chapter 12 of Eloquent JavaScript - Project: A programming language.
This section is quite confusing sometimes but when I started exercises some things are starting to *click* in my head.
I'll continue tomorrow.

## Pocket globe app *FINITO!*

Finally on Sunday I finished the app and posted in on the forum after three weeks of work :D 
I got some feedback about things that I could improve so later on I'll look into that but now, next project... 

## Habit tracker!

My next target is habit tracker and I've already have some troubles with choosing right data structures for all habits, days of the year, etc.
