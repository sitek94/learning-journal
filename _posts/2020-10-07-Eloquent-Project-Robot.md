## Morning learning

Chapter 7 and summary of everything I learned so far - project Robot.

We're building a robot that has to go around the village and deliver parcels. 

I went through all the chapter and I'm left with exercises.

## Pocket Globe App

Today at first I wanted to start implementing keyboard accessibility and widgets to control the globe but 
I noticed that the project is getting messy and out of control so I started refactoring a lot of stuff. 
I haven't finished yet and will continue tomorrow.

## PS
My brother's old computer is just amazing :D
