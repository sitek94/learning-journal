## Forum and Pocket globe app

I spent some chill time working on my app. When I did implement working searchbox I encountered yet another problem.
When trying to rotate projection to the country that is not visible on the globe the app crashes because it can't calculate the 
rotations for the object that doesn't exist.

Oh boy, I spent so much time trying to figure it out. I didn't want to just leave this feature. The solution I found is to grab the rotations from all
the countries manually. I've done it and already have all the data. I'll check tomorrow what can I do with it.

Additionaly I spent some time on the forum explaining recursion and helping out with some issue regarding MaterialUI.
