# Habit tracking app

## Today

I've been struggling for a while to delete both the habit and all its checkmarks when clicking on delete button.
Then I checked all the hooks, refactored and commented them. This should be all I need with regards to fetching and 
storing the data.

I've started adding User Performance panel and this is what it looks like so far:

It is going to display user's score for last week, this week and today.
