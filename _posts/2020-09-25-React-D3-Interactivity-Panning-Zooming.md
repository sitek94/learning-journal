## Talk recording from React Advanced 2019 Conference  

I watched this talk by Monica Wojciechowska to learn how to combine React and D3.
Inspired by the video I created a simple bar chart that is incredibly satisfying to play with.

## Interactive Scatter Plot

I implemented what I learned to my interactive scatter plot and it's now working.

## World Map and Globe

Now I'm working on adding panning and zooming to the world map and globe. It's fairly easy to apply the logic to the 
flat map but it's getting trickier to do the same thing with the globe.

I managed to do that but the code is a mess at the moment so I need to orginize it and optimize it because it's lagging.
