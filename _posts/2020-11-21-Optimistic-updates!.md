## Habit tracking app

It can't really be seen clearly in the commits because I've messed up the commit messages but most of the time today I've been working on making the checkmarks work again.

It's been quite a challenge because I feel like a noob when using React Query but! I made it work by the end of the day.

Two days ago I've had no idea that there is something like optimistic updates and today I've successfully implemented it. It's so satisfying :D 

Other than that I refactored `form` and `table`, created `checkbox-group` and did some cleanup work.
