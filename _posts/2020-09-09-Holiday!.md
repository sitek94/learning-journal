## Holiday!

After more than half a year of coding and learning almost everyday, I'm going on holiday 
to celebrate everything I learned so far. I'll be back sunday evening so back to coding on Monday.

It doesn't mean that I did nothing today though :D Today for 4 hrs I've been working on 
Choropleth Map. It looks all right, I managed to project the data on the map of USA, add borders
for each state and append a legend.

Total: 4.5hrs
