## New/old computer

Today I got my brother's old pc, because he's bought for himself a new one. 
So instead of learning and coding I've been cleaning my new machine both hardware (from dust, etc.)
and software (windows reinstall, etc.)

Everything is ready now and I honestly can't wait for tomorrow :D Just an example: when I create new react app
through create-react-app instead of waiting 6-7 minutes, I have to wait 27 seconds :D :D
