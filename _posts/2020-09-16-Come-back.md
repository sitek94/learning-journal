## Back from holiday

Holiday always feels good but it getting back to your old routine full of energy feels even better :D
This week still isn't going to be 100% productive because I've got friend's wedding on Friday but after that
there are no interuptions on the horizon for at least two months :D

## D3 

Finished Choropleth Map today, it's ready, passes all the test, just need to post it on the forum tomorrow.
