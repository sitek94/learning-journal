# Habit tracking app

## Today

Mostly I was working on hooks that fetch checkmarks data. I was reading docs and following examples on how to implement optimistic updates.
It's working pretty nice. I was able to greatly reduce the performance issues that I experienced yesterday.

## Problems

I removed Typescript from the project because of really nasty lags. Compiling was taking literally forever. I've seen other people referring to 
this issue and it's probably something to do with material-ui. Anyway I think it's for the best because this project is in pretty advanced state now
and it's not a good moment to start experimenting with technology that I have no idea how to use. When I finish this app, I'm going to start building
something from scratch with typescript because I really like how it all works.
