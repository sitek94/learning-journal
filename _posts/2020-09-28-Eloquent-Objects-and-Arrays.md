## Morning learning

First two hours of the day I spent with Eloquent JavaScript, chapter 5: Objects-and-Arrays.
I went through all the chapter and have been coding some examples myself, here are codepens with my notes: 
* [General Notes](https://codepen.io/sitek94/pen/YzqYOWj?editors=0110)
* [The sum of a range](https://codepen.io/sitek94/pen/wvGZLbP) - first exercise
* [Phi Coefficient Formulat](https://codepen.io/sitek94/pen/eYZoabG) - This formula is so cool. I'm going to use it with habit tracking app.

Rest of the day I spent building app. I've been struggling a lot with layout, specifically with photos component. I tried GridList from material ui, 
coding myself a grid, a dynamic grid from the tutorial on udemy. For the time being I'm going to leave the last one, and I'll see later how it goes.

I added simple navbar and footer and now I have to decide how do I want this to look like...
